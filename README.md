# connect_four  

The purpose of this project is to learn test driven development  
I had originally begun working on this project and took a very long break and decided to come back
and relearn the fundamentals of TDD and rewrite this project with a fresh mindset starting from scratch
as I felt the original tests were not working whatsoever. I also disliked the original structure as it seemed 
like a mess. The original project can be found in the branch "original" in it's near finished state.

To begin this project I intend to break down the individual pieces using a computational thinking process I've
learned in college from an applied problem solving class: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition and Data
Representation, Abstraction, then writing pseudo code or a flowchart to settle on the game logic.
I intend to strictly follow the red-green-refactor style of TDD to complete this project.
